## üîÑ What Was NOT Backfilled

These categories were originally allowed and should already be complete:
- **Category 0**: Main Games (already complete)
- **Category 4**: Standalone Expansions (already complete)
- **Category 8**: Enhanced Editions (already complete)

---

## üìù Maintenance Notes

### Regular Syncing
The existing `npm run sync-igdb` command will now include all categories since we removed filtering. Run periodically to keep database current.

### Re-enabling Filtering (if needed)
To restore filtering in the future:
1. Set `ENABLE_CONTENT_FILTERING = true` in `src/utils/contentProtectionFilter.ts`
2. Uncomment API filters in Netlify functions (marked with `‚ö†Ô∏è FILTERING DISABLED 2025-01-10`)
3. Add back `& category = 0` in `scripts/sync-igdb.js`

### Progress File
Delete `.backfill-progress.json` if you want to run the backfill script again from scratch.
