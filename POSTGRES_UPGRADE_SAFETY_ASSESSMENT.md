## Executive Summary

### ‚úÖ SAFE TO UPGRADE - With Preparations

Your database is **safe to upgrade** to PostgreSQL 17, but you need to complete a few preparation steps first. The upgrade is relatively low-risk for your application.

**Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW** (with preparation)
**Recommended Action:** ‚úÖ **Proceed with upgrade after completing checklist below**

---

## Your Database Analysis

### Extensions Used
Based on your migrations, you only use these extensions:
- ‚úÖ `pg_trgm` - Full-text search and similarity matching (SUPPORTED in PG17)
- ‚úÖ `uuid-ossp` - UUID generation (SUPPORTED in PG17)

**Good news:** You're NOT using any of the deprecated extensions (plv8, timescaledb, pgjwt, plls, plcoffee).

### Database Features Used

**‚úÖ Compatible Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) - 319+ policies
- PL/pgSQL functions - ~185 functions with `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Triggers - Extensive trigger usage
- Full-text search with `ts_vector`
- Materialized views
- Window functions (`PARTITION BY`)
- Foreign keys and constraints

**‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Check:**
- **BRIN Indexes:** You don't appear to have any BRIN indexes, so no reindexing needed
- **Custom Functions:** 185+ functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` - already properly secured with `SET search_path`

### Recent Security Hardening

Your latest migration (`20250930_fix_security_warnings.sql`) shows you've already:
- ‚úÖ Fixed all `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- ‚úÖ Secured materialized view access via functions
- ‚úÖ Fixed RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Removed auth.users exposure vulnerabilities

**This is excellent** - your database is already hardened for the upgrade.

## Breaking Changes Impact Assessment

### 1. Extension Deprecations
**Impact:** ‚úÖ **NONE**
**Reason:** You're only using `pg_trgm` and `uuid-ossp`, both fully supported in PG17.

### 2. BRIN Index Changes
**Impact:** ‚úÖ **NONE**
**Reason:** No BRIN indexes detected in your migrations.

### 3. ACL String Changes
**Impact:** üü° **MINIMAL**
**Reason:** If you have non-ASCII characters in role names (unlikely), they'll be quoted differently in ACL output. This is cosmetic and won't break functionality.

### 4. Wait Event Names
**Impact:** üü° **MINIMAL**
**Reason:** If you have external monitoring tools querying `pg_stat_activity` or `pg_wait_events`, you may need to update those queries after upgrade. Your application won't be affected.

### 5. Function Behavior Changes
**Impact:** ‚úÖ **NONE**
**Reason:** Standard PL/pgSQL functions are backward compatible. Your extensive use of `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path` is the correct pattern and will work perfectly.

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

### Critical Steps (Must Complete)

- [ ] **Backup Database** (Supabase does this automatically, but verify)
  - Create a manual snapshot before upgrade
  - Download a local backup via `pg_dump` if possible

- [ ] **Check for pgjwt Extension** (even if you don't use it)
  - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Extensions
  - If `pgjwt` is enabled, disable it (Supabase enabled it by default on PG15)
  - Wait 5 minutes for change to propagate

- [ ] **Review and Update Local Development**
  - If you use local Supabase, your local DB will need to be recreated
  - Docker volume will need to be deleted and reinitialized
  - Run: `supabase db reset` after upgrade to sync local with cloud

- [ ] **Check External Monitoring Tools**
  - If you have any external database monitors, note that wait event names may change
  - Update monitoring queries after upgrade if needed

### Nice-to-Have Steps

- [ ] **Test on Staging/Dev First** (if you have a separate Supabase project)
  - Upgrade a non-production instance first
  - Run your test suite against it
  - Verify application functionality

- [ ] **Notify Users** (optional, depends on your user base)
  - Schedule the upgrade during low-traffic period
  - Post a status notice if you have a status page

- [ ] **Prepare Rollback Plan**
  - Supabase supports point-in-time recovery
  - Document how to restore from backup if needed
  - Note: Rolling back from PG17 to PG15 requires restore from backup (not just downgrade)

## Migration-Specific Risks

### Your 117 Migrations Reviewed

**High Confidence Areas:**
1. **User authentication** - Standard Supabase auth patterns, fully compatible
2. **Game data model** - Standard tables with constraints, fully compatible
3. **Full-text search** - Using `pg_trgm` and `ts_vector`, both well-supported
4. **RLS policies** - Modern syntax, fully compatible
5. **Triggers and functions** - Already secured properly, compatible

**Low Risk Areas:**
1. **Referral system** (20250930 migration) - All functions already have `SET search_path`
2. **Privacy/GDPR system** - Standard table operations, compatible
3. **Activity feeds and notifications** - Standard patterns, compatible
4. **Game tracking and metrics** - Standard aggregations, compatible

**Potential Issues (Unlikely but check):**
1. **Materialized view `popular_searches`**
   - Already secured via function in latest migration
   - Should work fine, but verify after upgrade that `get_popular_searches()` still works

2. **185K+ games table performance**
   - PostgreSQL 17 has better query optimization
   - You may see *improved* performance on large table scans
   - Monitor query performance for first few days after upgrade

## Upgrade Process Recommendations

### Option 1: Low-Risk Upgrade (Recommended)

1. **Schedule Maintenance Window**
   - Choose low-traffic time (e.g., 3-5 AM in your primary user timezone)
   - Post notice 24-48 hours in advance if you have active users

2. **Pre-Upgrade (5 minutes)**
   - [ ] Create manual snapshot in Supabase Dashboard
   - [ ] Disable `pgjwt` extension if enabled
   - [ ] Put site in maintenance mode (optional)

3. **Execute Upgrade (Supabase handles this, ~30-60 minutes)**
   - [ ] Click "Upgrade" in Supabase Dashboard
   - [ ] Supabase will:
     - Take automatic backup
     - Upgrade PostgreSQL
     - Restart database
     - Run any necessary migrations

4. **Post-Upgrade Verification (15-30 minutes)**
   - [ ] Check Supabase Dashboard health status
   - [ ] Test core user flows:
     - User login/signup
     - Game search
     - Review creation
     - Profile viewing
   - [ ] Run a quick database query to verify data integrity:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game;
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "user";
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rating;
     ```
   - [ ] Check application logs for any database errors
   - [ ] Verify `get_popular_searches()` function works

5. **Monitor for 24-48 Hours**
   - Watch for any slow queries or errors
   - Check Supabase metrics dashboard
   - Be ready to restore from backup if critical issues arise

### Option 2: Ultra-Cautious Upgrade

If you have thousands of active users or can't afford any risk:

1. **Create a separate Supabase project for testing**
2. **Migrate your data to test project**
3. **Upgrade the test project to PG17**
4. **Run full test suite against test project**
5. **Load test with production-like traffic**
6. **Once confident, upgrade production**

## Expected Downtime Breakdown

**Supabase Estimate:** 1 hour
**Reality (based on your DB):**

- Small projects (< 1GB): 15-30 minutes
- Medium projects (1-10GB): 30-60 minutes
- Large projects (10GB+): 60-90 minutes

**Your project appears to be medium-sized** (185K+ games, plus user data), so expect:
- **30-45 minutes** for the actual upgrade
- **15-30 minutes** for verification and testing
- **Total: ~60-75 minutes** including buffer

---

## Rollback Strategy

### If Something Goes Wrong

**Option 1: Point-in-Time Recovery (Preferred)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
2. Restore to the snapshot taken just before upgrade
3. Downtime: ~30-60 minutes

**Option 2: Full Restore from Manual Backup**
1. Create new Supabase project
2. Restore from `pg_dump` backup
3. Update environment variables in your app
4. Downtime: 2-4 hours

**Important:** You cannot downgrade PG17 ‚Üí PG15 in place. You must restore from a backup.
