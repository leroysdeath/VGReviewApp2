## 🚧 Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Environment Problems
- **import.meta.env issues** in Jest prevent full test execution
- Need to fix TypeScript configuration for ES modules in tests
- Current workaround uses test environment detection

### API Rate Limiting Concerns
- Full analysis tests 160+ popular games across 32 franchises  
- Risk of hitting IGDB rate limits (4 req/sec, 20k/month)
- Need careful throttling and caching strategy

### Data Quality Variables
- Coverage depends on IGDB database completeness
- Regional game variations may be missed
- Subtitle/version matching accuracy varies

## 🎯 Next Steps to Run Analysis

### Option 1: Fix Test Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Fix Jest configuration for import.meta.env
# Then run full analysis:
node analyze-franchises.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Verification (Quick)
```bash
# Test sister game detection improvements:
searchDebugger.enable()
searchDebugger.testCustom("Resident Evil")
searchDebugger.testCustom("Metal Gear Solid") 
searchDebugger.testCustom("Assassins Creed")
```

### Option 3: Direct API Testing
- Use browser console to test enhanced search
- Check specific franchises manually
- Verify sister game detection patterns

## 📈 Expected Improvement Impact

### Before Enhancement
- **Estimated coverage**: ~40-60% for major franchises
