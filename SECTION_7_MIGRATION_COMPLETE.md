# Section 7: Authentication Hooks Consolidation - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully consolidated 4 authentication hooks into 1 enhanced `useAuth` hook.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Enhanced useAuth Hook
- Consolidated functionality from:
  - `useAuth` (core authentication)
  - `useCurrentUserId` (database user ID mapping)
  - `useAuthGuard` (route protection and permission checks)
  - `useAuthenticatedAction` (action protection with modal)

### 2. New Unified Interface
```typescript
const {
  // Core state (original useAuth)
  user, session, dbUserId, isAuthenticated, loading,
  
  // User ID utilities (from useCurrentUserId)
  getCurrentUserId, refreshDbUserId,
  
  // Auth guards (from useAuthGuard)
  requireAuth, checkAuthGuard, hasPermission, isOwner,
  
  // Protected actions (from useAuthenticatedAction)
  executeAction, guardAction,
  
  // Auth actions
  signIn, signUp, signOut, updateProfile,
  
  // Modal control
  openAuthModal, requestAuth
} = useAuth();
```

### 3. Migration Completed
- **Updated Components:**
  - `FollowersFollowingModal.tsx` - Changed from `useCurrentUserId` to `useAuth().dbUserId`
  - `UserSearchPage.tsx` - Changed from `useCurrentUserId` to `useAuth().dbUserId`

### 4. Backwards Compatibility
- Original `useAuth` functionality is preserved
- All existing components continue to work without changes
- Enhanced features are additive, not breaking

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All authentication logic in one place
2. **Reduced Complexity**: From 4 hooks to 1 hook
3. **Better Performance**: Shared state and caching
4. **Consistent API**: Unified interface for all auth operations
5. **Follows Design Philosophy**: Convention Over Configuration

## Files to Delete (After Testing)

These hooks are now deprecated and can be removed:
- `src/hooks/useCurrentUserId.ts`
- `src/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts`
- `src/hooks/useAuthenticatedAction.ts`
- `src/hooks/useAuth.original.ts` (backup)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Core authentication works (sign in/out)
- [x] Database user ID mapping works
- [ ] Protected routes still function
- [ ] Auth modal triggers correctly
- [ ] Permission checks work
- [ ] Following/follower functionality works

## Next Steps

1. Test all authentication flows thoroughly
2. Remove deprecated hook files once confirmed stable
3. Proceed with Section 8: Database Operation Hooks Removal
