🚀 How to Use It:

  # 1. Start netlify dev (for IGDB API access)
  netlify dev

  # 2. In another terminal, test it first:
  npm run sync-igdb:dry

  # 3. If it looks good, run it for real:
  npm run sync-igdb

  # 4. Custom options:
  node scripts/sync-igdb.js --days 14 --limit 100

  🛡️ Safety Features:

  - ✅ Dry run mode - See what would be synced without making changes
  - ✅ Local only - Won't affect your production/remote database
  - ✅ Duplicate prevention - Won't add games that already exist
  - ✅ Error handling - Continues even if some games fail
  - ✅ Detailed logging - Shows exactly what's happening

  📊 What Gets Synced:

  - Game names, descriptions, release dates
  - IGDB ratings and cover images (high quality)
  - Genres, developers, publishers, platforms
  - Proper IGDB IDs for future reference

  🧪 Test It:

  1. Make sure netlify dev is running
  2. Run npm run sync-igdb:dry to see what would happen
  3. Run npm run sync-igdb to actually sync games

  The system will tell you exactly how many games it found, which ones are new, and how many it added to your
  database. Perfect for keeping your local game database current with IGDB updates!



 🎯 Ready to Test:

  1. Make sure netlify dev is running (for the IGDB API):
  netlify dev
  2. In another terminal, test the sync:
  # Test what would be synced (safe dry run)
  npm run sync-igdb:dry

  # Or run for real
  npm run sync-igdb
  3. Custom options:
  # Check last 3 days only
  node scripts/sync-igdb.js --dry-run --days 3 --limit 20

  What the script will do:

  1. ✅ Load your .env file (including Supabase credentials)
  2. 🔍 Check IGDB for games updated in the last 7 days
  3. 📊 Compare against your local Supabase database
  4. 🆕 Find games that aren't in your database yet
  5. 💾 Add new games to your local database (with full metadata)

  The sync should now work properly with your environment variables! Try running npm run sync-igdb:dry first to see        
  what games it would sync.
  npm run sync-igdb -- --days 14 --limit 100 -checks games from the last 14 days
