# Phase 2 Implementation Results

## Summary
Attempted to insert 4 missing Pokemon games but discovered the IGDB IDs in our action plan were incorrect.

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Write Permissions
- Cannot directly INSERT into the game table (permission denied)
- Need alternative approach to add missing games

### 2. IGDB ID Mismatches
The IGDB IDs we planned to use are already in the database but point to DIFFERENT games:

| Planned Game | Planned IGDB ID | Actual Game in DB with that ID |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Pokémon Trading Card Game | 7350 | Get Even |
| Pokémon FireRed Version | 1514 | Pokémon Crystal Version |
| Pokémon Black Version | 119387 | No More Heroes III |
| Pokémon Black Version 2 | 119376 | Little Idle Monsters |

### 3. Games Actually Found
- **Pokémon FireRed Version**: EXISTS in database with IGDB ID **1559** (not 1514)
- **Pokémon Trading Card Game**: NOT FOUND in database
- **Pokémon Black Version**: NOT FOUND in database
- **Pokémon Black Version 2**: NOT FOUND in database
- **Pokémon Sword**: NOT FOUND in database
- **Pokémon Shield**: NOT FOUND in database
- **Pokémon Legends: Arceus**: NOT FOUND (didn't search yet)

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Find correct IGDB IDs** for missing games:
   - Need to use IGDB API to get correct IDs for:
     - Pokémon Trading Card Game (Game Boy Color)
     - Pokémon Black Version
     - Pokémon Black Version 2
     - Pokémon Sword
     - Pokémon Shield
     - Pokémon Legends: Arceus

2. **Alternative insertion method** since direct INSERT is blocked:
   - Option A: Create a migration file for deployment
   - Option B: Use Supabase dashboard
   - Option C: Use API endpoint that has write permissions

3. **Update action plan** with correct IGDB IDs once found

## Conclusion
Phase 2 could not be completed as planned due to:
1. Incorrect IGDB IDs in our action plan
2. Database write permissions restriction
3. Some games truly missing from database (Black, Black 2, Sword, Shield, Trading Card Game)

FireRed is already in the database but with a different IGDB ID than expected.
