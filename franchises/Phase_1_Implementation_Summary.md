## Technical Implementation

### Migration Structure
```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO game (...) VALUES
  (unique_id, name, slug, franchise, platforms, ...)
ON CONFLICT (game_id) DO NOTHING;
UPDATE game SET search_vector = ...;
UPDATE game SET search_aliases = ...;
COMMIT;
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Unique IDs**: Used descriptive game_ids like 'gw_ball_1980' for clarity
2. **Platform Arrays**: Stored as PostgreSQL arrays for flexibility
3. **Manual Tracking**: data_source='manual' identifies these entries
4. **Search Enhancement**: Both tsvector and JSONB aliases for discovery
5. **Null Safety**: Appropriate NULL values for unknown dates/data

## Immediate Next Steps

### For User to Execute:
1. **Apply Migration 1** via Supabase Dashboard
2. **Apply Migration 2** via Supabase Dashboard
3. **Verify with provided queries**
4. **Report any issues encountered**

### Future Phases (As Planned):

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Collections & Remasters
- Focus on compilation releases
- HD remasters and definitive editions
- Platform-specific collections

**Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10)**: Regional Content
- Japan-exclusive titles
- PAL-only releases
- Region-specific variations

**Phase 4 (Weeks 11-14)**: Digital/Mobile
