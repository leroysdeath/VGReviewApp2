## Cultural Impact
Spyro the Dragon established many conventions for 3D collect-a-thon platformers and became one of PlayStation's most beloved mascot characters. The original trilogy showcased Insomniac Games' technical prowess and design philosophy that would later influence Ratchet & Clank. The character's redesign in Skylanders sparked controversy among fans but introduced Spyro to a new generation, while the Reignited Trilogy's success demonstrated strong demand for faithful remasters.

## Database Notes
- Enter the Dragonfly is often noted for its poor quality and rushed development
- Game Boy Advance games were 2D isometric rather than 3D platformers
- Mobile versions may not be well-documented due to limited availability
- Skylanders appearances feature a significantly redesigned character
- Regional title differences may cause confusion in databases
- Some consider only the original trilogy as "core" Spyro games
