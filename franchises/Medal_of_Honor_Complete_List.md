- **2010-2012**: Modern warfare reboot competing with Call of Duty
- **2020**: VR revival with Above and Beyond

### Note on Search Results:
The query returned many false positives due to common military gaming terms like "frontline", "airborne", and "allied assault" appearing in unrelated game titles.
