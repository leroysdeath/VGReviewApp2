## Cultural Impact
Diablo created the modern action RPG genre and established the template for loot-driven gameplay. The series pioneered random dungeon generation, online multiplayer RPGs, and the "Skinner box" progression systems that influenced countless games. Diablo's dark gothic aesthetic and addictive gameplay loop became the gold standard for hack-and-slash RPGs.

## Database Notes
- Hellfire expansion was developed by Sierra, not Blizzard, and may not always be included
- Console versions often had different features from PC versions
- Diablo Immortal faced significant controversy but is still part of the official franchise
- Seasonal content updates are extensive but not counted as separate games
- Ultimate Evil Edition and Eternal Collection are enhanced console releases
