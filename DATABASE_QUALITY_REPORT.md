### Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Fix sync system | Critical | Medium |
| **P0** | Populate genres | Critical | Low |
| **P1** | Add categories | High | Low |
| **P1** | Sync 2023-2024 games | High | Low |
| **P2** | Store integration | Medium | High |
| **P2** | Deduplicate games | Medium | Medium |
| **P3** | Alternative names | Low | Low |
| **P3** | Verification system | Low | High |

## Conclusion

The database contains a solid foundation with 125K games and excellent IGDB ID coverage, but critical functionality gaps prevent it from reaching its potential. The broken sync system is the most urgent issue, as it prevents all automated data updates. Once sync is restored, the focus should shift to populating the severely lacking genre and category data, which are essential for user discovery and navigation.

With focused effort on the P0 and P1 priorities, the database can be brought to a functional state within 2-4 weeks. Full optimization including store integration and comprehensive verification would require 2-3 months of sustained effort.
