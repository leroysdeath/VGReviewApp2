# Security Fixes for Supabase Database

## Issues Identified

The Supabase security linter found the following critical issues:

1. **`auth_users_exposed`** - The `game_flags_admin` view exposes `auth.users` data to anonymous users
2. **`security_definer_view`** - Views using `SECURITY DEFINER` bypass Row Level Security (RLS)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed auth.users Exposure (Critical)

**Problem:** `game_flags_admin` view was joining with `auth.users` and exposing email addresses:
```sql
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON g.flagged_by = u.id
u.email as flagged_by_email  -- ‚ùå SECURITY RISK
```

**Solution:** Use internal user table instead:
```sql
LEFT JOIN "user" u ON g.flagged_by = u.provider_id
u.username as flagged_by_username  -- ‚úÖ SAFE
```

### 2. Fixed Security Definer Views

**Problem:** Views created with `SECURITY DEFINER` bypass RLS policies
**Solution:** Recreated views with `security_invoker=true` to respect RLS

### 3. Removed Unused Views

- Removed `game_import_queue_status` view (not found in migrations but flagged by linter)

## Files Created

1. **`20250922_comprehensive_security_fixes.sql`** - Complete security fix migration (all-in-one)

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Apply the comprehensive security fixes
supabase db push

# Or apply the specific migration
supabase migration repair 20250922_comprehensive_security_fixes
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
1. Copy the SQL content from the migration files
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Verify no errors occur

## Verification

After applying the fixes, run these queries to verify:

```sql
-- Check that game_flags_admin no longer exposes auth.users
SELECT * FROM audit_auth_users_exposure();

-- Verify RLS coverage
SELECT * FROM audit_rls_coverage();

-- Check function security settings
SELECT * FROM audit_function_security();
```

## Expected Results

After applying the fixes:
- ‚úÖ `auth_users_exposed` error should be resolved
- ‚úÖ `security_definer_view` errors should be resolved
- ‚úÖ Views will respect RLS policies
- ‚úÖ No sensitive auth data exposed to anonymous users

## Additional Security Measures

The audit script also provides:
- üõ°Ô∏è Continuous monitoring functions
- üìã Security guidelines documentation
- üö® Optional prevention triggers (commented out for safety)

## Important Notes

- **Admin Access**: Update RLS policies to properly restrict admin functions
- **Testing**: Test admin functionality after applying fixes
- **Monitoring**: Run security audits regularly using the provided functions
- **Documentation**: Review `security_guidelines` table for best practices

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never expose auth.users** - Always use internal user table
2. **Use security_invoker** - Let views respect RLS policies  
3. **Enable RLS** - On all tables with user data
4. **Audit regularly** - Use the provided audit functions
5. **Minimal permissions** - Grant only what's necessary
