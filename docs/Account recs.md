  Recommended Actions

  Would you like me to:

  1. Check the avatar_url content - See what's actually in that massive field (might be base64 image data)
  2. Run the other queries from COMPARE_LEROY_ACCOUNT.sql to check:
    - Auth.users table status
    - RLS policy issues
    - Related data (ratings, reviews)
  3. Fix the email verification - Update the database to mark email as verified
  4. Clean up the avatar_url - Replace with a proper URL or null
