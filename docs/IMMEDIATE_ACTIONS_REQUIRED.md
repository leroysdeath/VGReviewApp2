# Immediate Actions Required

## What I Just Did

1. ‚úÖ **Enabled DEBUG_USER_SERVICE** in `src/services/userService.ts` (line 28)
   - This will show detailed console logs for every database operation
   - You'll see exactly what's failing and why

2. ‚úÖ **Cleared Vite Cache**
   - Removed `node_modules/.vite` directory
   - This ensures code changes are picked up

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Run the RLS Policy Reset (CRITICAL)

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run this entire file:
```
docs/FIX_RLS_FORCE_SIMPLE.sql
```

**Expected output**: Should show 3 policies and leroysdeath's user record at the end.

**Share with me**:
- The policy list (should show 3: auth_all, anon_read, anon_write)
- The test query result (should show leroysdeath's record)

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
netlify dev
```

### Step 3: Test Login

1. Open browser to your dev server URL
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Log in as leroysdeath
4. **Look for debug logs** - you should now see detailed messages like:
   - `üîÑ Calling get_or_create_user function`
   - `‚úÖ Database function succeeded`
   - OR detailed error messages

### Step 4: Share Console Output

Copy ALL the console logs (especially ones starting with üîÑ, ‚úÖ, or ‚ùå) and share them with me.

## Why This Will Work

1. **RLS policies** will be simplified to 3 that definitely work
2. **Debug mode** will show us exactly what's happening
3. **Cache cleared** ensures code changes are active
4. **Fresh dev server** picks up all changes

## If Still Failing

If you still see errors after these steps, the debug logs will tell us exactly what's wrong and we can fix it immediately.
