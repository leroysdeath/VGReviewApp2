# Browser Cache Is Blocking Code Changes

## The Problem

You're not seeing the debug logs (🔄, ℹ️, ✅, ❌) which means the browser is still running **OLD CACHED CODE**, even though:
- ✅ Code changes are saved
- ✅ Vite cache is cleared
- ✅ Dev server restarted

## The Solution - Nuclear Browser Clear

### Firefox Instructions:

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)

2. **Go to Storage tab** (not Console)

3. **Right-click on your site** (localhost:8888 or localhost:5173) in the left panel

4. **Click "Delete All"** - this clears:
   - Cookies
   - Local Storage
   - Session Storage
   - IndexedDB
   - Cache Storage
   - Service Workers

5. **Close DevTools**

6. **Hard refresh**: Hold `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

7. **Log in again** as leroysdeath

## What You Should See

Once the cache is cleared, you should see these debug logs in the console:

```
🔍 Getting current auth user...
👤 Auth user result: { user: { id: '8c06387a...', email: 'joshuateusink@yahoo.com' }, authError: null }
🔄 Calling get_or_create_user function
ℹ️ Skipping RPC function, using direct database operations
🔍 Getting user profile for provider_id: 8c06387a-5ee0-413e-bd94-b8cb29610d9d
✅ Found user profile: { id: 1, username: 'leroysdeath', ... }
```

## If You STILL Don't See Debug Logs

Then the dev server might not have picked up the changes. Try:

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear Vite cache AGAIN
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Restart
netlify dev
```

## The HTTP 400 Errors

These will likely **disappear** once the new code runs, because the new code:
1. Skips the RPC function (which was causing issues)
2. Uses direct database operations
3. Has much better error handling

The debug logs will tell us exactly what's happening at each step.
