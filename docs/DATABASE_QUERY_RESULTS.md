# Database Health Check Results

**Date**: Awaiting user to run queries
**Status**: Pending - Queries need to be run in Supabase SQL Editor

---

## Instructions

Run these 5 priority queries in Supabase SQL Editor and paste the results below each query.

---

## Query 1 - First User Record

**Purpose**: Check if the first user's record has data corruption

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT id, provider_id, email, username, name, created_at, updated_at
FROM "user"
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Results**:
```
[PASTE RESULTS HERE]
```

**Analysis**:
- [ ] All fields populated (no NULLs)
- [ ] provider_id is valid UUID format
- [ ] email matches expected account
- [ ] username is set
- [ ] name is set

---

## Query 2 - Orphaned Auth Records

**Purpose**: Find users who have auth but no database record (signup failures)

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT auth.users.id AS auth_id, auth.users.email AS auth_email,
       auth.users.created_at AS auth_created, "user".id AS db_user_id
FROM auth.users
LEFT JOIN "user" ON auth.users.id::TEXT = "user".provider_id
WHERE "user".id IS NULL
ORDER BY auth.users.created_at ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results**:
```
[PASTE RESULTS HERE]
```

**Analysis**:
- [ ] Should return 0 rows (all auth users have DB records)
- [ ] If rows returned: `get_or_create_user` failed for these users

---

## Query 3 - Duplicate Provider IDs

**Purpose**: Check for duplicate provider_ids (should be impossible with unique constraint)

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT provider_id, COUNT(*) as count,
       ARRAY_AGG(id) as user_ids, ARRAY_AGG(email) as emails
FROM "user"
GROUP BY provider_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Results**:
```
[PASTE RESULTS HERE]
```

**Analysis**:
- [ ] Should return 0 rows (provider_id has unique constraint)
- [ ] If rows returned: Database constraint violation, data corruption

---

## Query 4 - User Statistics

**Purpose**: Show total users and recent signup activity

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 1 END) as users_last_7_days,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN 1 END) as users_last_24_hours,
       MIN(created_at) as first_user_created,
       MAX(created_at) as last_user_created
FROM "user";
```

**Results**:
```
[PASTE RESULTS HERE]
```

**Analysis**:
- [ ] total_users matches expected count
- [ ] Recent signups indicate healthy user creation
- [ ] first_user_created shows when first user signed up

---

## Query 5 - Invalid Data Check

**Purpose**: Find users with missing required data

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT id, provider_id, email, username, name, created_at
FROM "user"
WHERE provider_id IS NULL OR email IS NULL OR email = '' OR provider_id = ''
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Results**:
```
[PASTE RESULTS HERE]
```

**Analysis**:
- [ ] Should return 0 rows (all required fields populated)
- [ ] If rows returned: Data validation failed during creation

---

## Diagnosis Summary - Queries 1-5

**Issue Type**: âœ… **NO DATABASE ISSUES FOUND**

**Database Health**: ðŸŸ¢ **EXCELLENT**

### Analysis of Results:

**Query 1 - First User Record**: âœ… **HEALTHY**
- All fields properly populated
- Valid UUID: `8c06387a-5ee0-413e-bd94-b8cb29610d9d`
- Email: `joshuateusink@yahoo.com`
- Username: `leroysdeath`
- Created: July 22, 2025
- Updated: October 11, 2025 (recently active)

**Query 2 - Orphaned Auth Records**: âœ… **CLEAN**
- Zero orphaned records
- All auth users have corresponding DB records
- User creation flow is working correctly

**Query 3 - Duplicate Provider IDs**: âœ… **NO DUPLICATES**
- Unique constraint is enforced
- No race condition issues
- Data integrity maintained

**Query 4 - User Statistics**: âœ… **HEALTHY GROWTH**
- 30 total users
- 5 new users in last 7 days
- 4 new users in last 24 hours
- Active signup flow

**Query 5 - Invalid Data**: âœ… **ALL VALID**
- No NULL or empty critical fields
- All users have required data

### Conclusion from Queries 1-5:

**The "first user can't interact" issue is NOT a database problem.**

The database is in excellent health. This means the issue is almost certainly:
1. **Browser state/cache synchronization** (most likely)
2. **RLS permissions** (less likely, but worth checking)
3. **Client-side state management** (dbUserId fetch timing)

**Next Step**: âœ… Query 6 completed - results analyzed below.

---

## Query 6 Analysis - CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Result**: 10 users with ZERO interactions (no reviews, no comments)

### Key Observations:

ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT**: The first user (`leroysdeath`, ID 1, `joshuateusink@yahoo.com`) is **NOT in this list**

This means the first user **HAS successfully created reviews/comments** - they CAN interact with the site!

### Users Who Can't Interact (or haven't tried):

All 10 users with zero interactions are from **August-September 2025** (not the first user from July):

- **ID 3**: `testboyo` (thomas.waalkes@gmail.com) - August 1
- **IDs 110-117**: Test accounts (thomas.waalkes+test variants) - September 9
- **ID 122**: `goingdown18` (mychal.galla@gmail.com) - September 9

### Conclusion:

**The "first user can't interact" report appears to be FALSE or outdated.**

The first user (`leroysdeath`) has successfully created content. The issue may be:
1. **They were experiencing a temporary cache issue** (now resolved)
2. **They reported difficulty but it was a different problem** (not inability to interact)
3. **The issue was browser-specific and temporary** (Service Worker cache)

### Real Issue Identified:

You have **10 users** (mostly test accounts from September) who have zero interactions. These could be:
- Test accounts you created for debugging
- Users who signed up but never engaged
- Users experiencing the cache/state issues we documented

**Recommendation**: Focus on the browser-specific cache clearing solution from USER_STATE_DEBUGGING_PLAN.md for any users still experiencing issues.

  SELECT id, provider_id, email, username, name, created_at
