  The Problem: Missing Supabase Auth Token

  Your local storage shows:
  - ✅ following_users
  - ✅ gamevault_consent_shown
  - ✅ gamevault_privacy_consent
  - ✅ gamevault_session_id
  - ✅ user_recent_searches

  But MISSING:
  - ❌ sb-cqufmmnguumyhbkhgwdc-auth-token (the Supabase auth session!)

  This is why you're getting 400 errors - you're not actually logged in from the browser's perspective. The Supabase client has no auth token, so all requests are being made as        
  anonymous.

  Why This Happened

  When you "log in" as leroysdeath, the login appears to succeed in the UI, but Supabase isn't actually storing the session token in local storage. This could be:

  1. Login completes but session storage fails
  2. Auth state gets cleared immediately after login
  3. Supabase client initialization issue

  Quick Test

  In the browser console, type:

  await supabase.auth.getSession()

  This will show if there's a session in memory. Share the output. If it says session: null, then the login didn't actually work.

  Then we'll need to look at the login flow to see where it's failing to persist the session.
