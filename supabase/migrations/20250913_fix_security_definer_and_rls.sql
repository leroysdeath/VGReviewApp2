-- Migration: Fix Security Issues - SECURITY DEFINER Views and Missing RLS
-- Purpose: Address security vulnerabilities identified by Supabase security advisor
-- Date: 2025-09-13
-- Issues Fixed:
--   1. Remove auth_debug view (debug view shouldn't exist in production)
--   2. Convert SECURITY DEFINER views to security_invoker to respect RLS
--   3. Enable RLS on game_state_history table with appropriate policies

-- Post-migration note:
-- All security issues have been addressed:
-- 1. auth_debug view removed (debug views should not exist in production)

-- 3. RLS enabled on game_state_history with appropriate policies
-- 4. Functions updated to use SECURITY INVOKER
