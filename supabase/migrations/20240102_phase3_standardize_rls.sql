-- Phase 3: Standardize ALL RLS Policies for Performance
-- This migration replaces all is_user_owner() function calls with inline SQL

-- 1. First, let's create a better is_user_owner function for tables that truly need it
-- But mark it as deprecated
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_user_owner(user_id_to_check integer)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
STABLE -- Removed SECURITY DEFINER for better auth context
SET search_path = public, auth, pg_temp -- Fixed syntax
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.user 
        WHERE id = user_id_to_check 
        AND provider_id = auth.uid()
    );
END;
$$;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION is_user_owner(integer) IS 
'DEPRECATED: Use inline SQL in RLS policies for better performance. Only kept for backwards compatibility.';

-- 2. Fix rating table RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own ratings" ON rating;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own ratings" ON rating
FOR ALL
USING (
    -- Can view if published OR if owner
    is_published = true 
    OR user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
)
WITH CHECK (
    -- Can only insert/update/delete if owner
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- 3. Fix notification table RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own notifications" ON notification;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own notifications" ON notification;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own notifications" ON notification
FOR SELECT
USING (
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own notifications" ON notification
FOR UPDATE
USING (
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
)
WITH CHECK (
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- 4. Fix user_follow table RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own follows" ON user_follow;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own follows" ON user_follow
FOR ALL
USING (true)  -- Anyone can view follows
WITH CHECK (
    follower_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- 5. Fix user_game_list table RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own lists" ON user_game_list;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own lists" ON user_game_list
FOR ALL
USING (
    -- Can view if public OR if owner
    is_public = true 
    OR user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
)
WITH CHECK (
    -- Can only modify if owner
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- 6. Fix user_preferences table RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "User preferences policy" ON user_preferences;
CREATE POLICY "User preferences policy" ON user_preferences
FOR ALL
USING (
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
)
WITH CHECK (
    user_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM "user" 
        WHERE provider_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- 7. Add comments to document the optimizations
COMMENT ON POLICY "Users can manage own ratings" ON rating IS 
'Optimized inline SQL policy. Users can view published ratings or their own. Can only modify their own.';

COMMENT ON POLICY "Users can manage own follows" ON user_follow IS 
'Optimized inline SQL policy. Anyone can view follows, only follower can create/delete.';

COMMENT ON POLICY "Users can manage own lists" ON user_game_list IS 
'Optimized inline SQL policy. Public lists visible to all, private lists only to owner.';

-- 8. Create helper view for debugging auth issues
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW auth_debug AS
SELECT 
    auth.uid() as auth_uid,
    u.id as user_id,
    u.provider_id,
    u.email,
    u.username,
    (auth.uid() = u.provider_id) as is_matched
FROM "user" u
WHERE u.provider_id = auth.uid();

COMMENT ON VIEW auth_debug IS 
'Helper view for debugging authentication issues. Shows current auth context.';
