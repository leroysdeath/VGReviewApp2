# Priority-Based Search Implementation

## Overview
Transformed the search system from an aggressive filtering approach to a priority-based ranking system. This change addresses the issue where searches like "Pokemon" were showing only 25 games out of 166 available in the database.

## Problem Statement
The previous search implementation used 8 stages of aggressive filtering:
1. Query expansion and multiple searches
2. Relevance filtering (0.4 threshold)
3. Early termination (80 games max)
4. Content protection filter (removed collections)
5. Fan game filter
6. Quality threshold filter (0.6 threshold)
7. Intelligent sorting
8. Final limit (40 games)

This resulted in losing ~85% of relevant games, showing only 25 Pokemon games instead of all 166.

## Solution: Priority-Based Ranking

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Reduced Quality Thresholds (`calculateQualityThreshold`)
**Before:**
- Specific game searches: 0.8
- Popular franchises: 0.6
- Other franchises: 0.4
- Genre/Year discovery: 0.3
- Default: 0.5

**After:**
- Specific game searches: 0.3 (↓ from 0.8)
- Popular franchises: 0.1 (↓ from 0.6)
- Other franchises: 0.2 (↓ from 0.4)
- Genre/Year discovery: 0.2 (↓ from 0.3)
- Default: 0.3 (↓ from 0.5)

#### 2. Increased Result Limits (`getDefaultMaxResults`)
**Before:**
- Specific game: 20
- Franchise browse: 40
- Genre discovery: 50
- Year/Developer/Platform: 40

**After:**
- Specific game: 50 (↑ from 20)
- Franchise browse: 200 (↑ from 40)
- Genre discovery: 100 (↑ from 50)
- Year search: 100 (↑ from 40)
- Developer search: 150 (↑ from 40)
- Platform search: 150 (↑ from 40)

#### 3. Reduced Relevance Filtering
**Before:** Filter out games with relevance < 0.4
**After:** Filter out games with relevance < 0.1

#### 4. Increased Early Termination Thresholds
**Before:**
- Franchise searches: Stop at 80 games
- Other searches: Stop at 40 games

**After:**
- Franchise searches: Stop at 250 games (↑ from 80)
- Other searches: Stop at 150 games (↑ from 40)

#### 5. Conditional Filtering (`processSearchResults`)
Popular franchises now skip aggressive content and fan game filtering:

```typescript
const popularFranchises = ['mario', 'zelda', 'pokemon', 'final fantasy', 'call of duty', 'sonic', 'mega man'];
const isPopularFranchise = popularFranchises.some(franchise =>
  context.originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes(franchise)
);

// Only apply filters for non-franchise searches
if (!isPopularFranchise && context.searchIntent !== SearchIntent.FRANCHISE_BROWSE) {
  // Apply content and fan game filters
}
```

#### 6. Composite Scoring System (`calculateCompositeScore`)
New ranking system that combines multiple factors instead of filtering:

**Scoring Components:**
- **Relevance (40%)**: How well the game matches the search query
- **Quality (25%)**: Metadata completeness and ratings
- **Canonical (20%)**: Main games score higher than DLC/collections
- **Popularity (10%)**: Based on metadata completeness
- **Recency (5%)**: Newer games get a slight boost

**Canonical Detection:**
- Main entries get +0.15 bonus
- Exact matches or numbered entries get additional +0.1
- DLCs, expansions, packs, editions, and collections score lower

**Popularity Indicators:**
- Has developer/publisher: +0.05
- Has genres: +0.05
- Has detailed summary: +0.05
- Has cover image: +0.05

**Recency Bonus:**
- Released within 2 years: +0.10
- Released within 5 years: +0.05
- Released within 10 years: +0.02

## Expected Results

### Before (Filtering Approach)
- Pokemon search: 166 → 25 games (85% filtered out)
- Mario search: ~200 → ~40 games
- Final Fantasy search: ~100 → ~30 games

### After (Priority-Based Ranking)
- Pokemon search: 166 → up to 200 games (all shown, ranked by relevance)
- Mario search: ~200 → up to 200 games
- Final Fantasy search: ~100 → up to 100 games

## Benefits

1. **Complete Results**: Users see all relevant games, not just a filtered subset
2. **Better Discovery**: Hidden gems and older titles are discoverable
3. **Intelligent Ordering**: Best matches appear first through composite scoring
4. **Franchise Completeness**: Popular franchises show their entire catalog
5. **Flexible System**: Easy to adjust weights and bonuses for different scenarios

## Implementation Files Modified

### `src/services/advancedSearchCoordination.ts`
- Modified `calculateQualityThreshold()`: Lowered all thresholds
- Modified `getDefaultMaxResults()`: Increased all limits
- Modified `executeCoordinatedSearch()`: Reduced relevance filter and increased termination
- Modified `processSearchResults()`: Added conditional filtering and composite scoring
- Added `calculateCompositeScore()`: New comprehensive ranking system

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Pokemon search**: Should now show 150+ games instead of 25
2. **Test Mario search**: Should show 100+ games
3. **Test Final Fantasy search**: Should show 50+ games
4. **Verify ranking order**: Main games should appear before DLC/collections
5. **Check performance**: Ensure search is still responsive with more results

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Preferences**: Allow users to adjust ranking weights
2. **Filter Options**: Add optional filters users can toggle
3. **Smart Grouping**: Group related games (e.g., all Pokemon Red versions)
4. **Personalized Ranking**: Consider user's play history and preferences
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare filtering vs ranking approaches with metrics

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be easily reverted by:
1. Restoring original threshold values in `calculateQualityThreshold()`
2. Restoring original limits in `getDefaultMaxResults()`
3. Removing the composite scoring system
4. Re-enabling unconditional filtering

All changes are localized to `advancedSearchCoordination.ts` making rollback straightforward.
