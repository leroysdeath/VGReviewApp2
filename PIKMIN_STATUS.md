## üîç Why They Might Not Show in Frontend Search

If Pikmin 1 and 2 for Switch aren't appearing in your frontend, it could be:

### 1. Frontend Search Query Issue
Your frontend might be:
- Searching by exact name match instead of fuzzy search
- Filtering by specific criteria that excludes them
- Having database timeout issues on the search query
- Using a search index that needs refreshing

### 2. Search Terms
The games are named:
- "Pikmin 1" (not "Pikmin 1 Switch" or "Pikmin for Switch")
- "Pikmin 2" (not "Pikmin 2 Switch")
- "Pikmin 1+2 Bundle"

So searching for "Pikmin 1+2" might not match "Pikmin 1+2 Bundle" depending on your search logic.

### 3. Client-Side Filtering
Even though we disabled `ENABLE_CONTENT_FILTERING`, your frontend might have other filters:
- Platform filters
- Release date filters
- Category filters
- Rating/popularity thresholds

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Direct IGDB API Search (Should Work)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/igdb-search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "pikmin 1", "limit": 10, "minimal": true}'
```

### Test 2: Database Query (Should Work)
Check if the games exist in your database with a direct SQL query or via Supabase dashboard:
```sql
SELECT name, igdb_id, platforms, release_date
FROM game
WHERE igdb_id IN (254334, 254335, 254343);
```

### Test 3: Frontend Search
Try these searches in your frontend:
- "pikmin 1"
- "pikmin 2"
- "pikmin bundle"
- Just "pikmin" (should show all)

## üîß If Still Not Showing

### Check Your Frontend Search Code

Look at how your search is implemented:

1. **Check search service** (`src/services/gameDataServiceV2.ts` or similar)
   - Does it query local Supabase or IGDB directly?
   - Are there any hardcoded filters?
   - Is there a LIMIT clause that's too low?

2. **Check search components** (`src/pages/SearchResultsPage.tsx`)
   - Any client-side filtering after results are returned?
   - Platform filters enabled?
   - Sort order hiding recent games?

3. **Check for timeout issues**
   - Your database has timeouts on ILIKE queries
   - Might need to add search indices
   - Or use full-text search instead

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Test frontend search** for "pikmin 1" specifically
2. **Check browser console** for any errors
3. **Look at network tab** to see what query is being sent
4. **Verify the frontend is searching the right endpoint**
5. **Check if there are platform/date filters active**

If you share the frontend search code or error messages, I can help debug why they're not appearing!
