# Avatar Content Moderation Strategy for Teen Gaming Platform (16+)

This document outlines the content moderation strategy for user-uploaded avatars on a gaming review platform with a minimum age requirement of 16 years.

## 1. Stricter Content Filtering

### More Conservative Thresholds
- Set moderation sensitivity to **"strict"** mode
- Lower tolerance for suggestive content (not just explicit)
- Flag borderline cases that might be appropriate for adults but questionable for teens
- Include violence/gore filtering (teens may share gaming content that's inappropriate)

### Enhanced Categories to Monitor
- Suggestive poses/clothing
- Alcohol/drug references
- Violent imagery
- Hate symbols/extremist content
- Self-harm imagery

## 2. Age-Appropriate Moderation Services

### Recommended: Google Cloud Vision AI Safe Search
- Has specific "teen-safe" filtering modes
- Better at detecting suggestive (not just explicit) content
- Can flag "racy" content that's legal but inappropriate for teens

### Alternative: AWS Rekognition with Custom Rules
- Set conservative confidence thresholds
- Reject anything above 60% confidence for "suggestive" (instead of 80%)
- Add custom detection for gaming-related inappropriate content

## 3. Enhanced Safety Measures

### Account Verification
- **Email verification required** before avatar upload
- **Phone verification** for additional trust layer
- **Account age minimum** (7+ days before avatar upload allowed)

### Community Standards
- **Stricter terms of service** mentioning teen audience
- **Zero tolerance policy** for inappropriate content
- **Permanent bans** for violations (teens need clear consequences)

## 4. Teen-Specific Risk Mitigation

### Additional Protections
- **No custom avatars initially** - must use platform for X days first
- **Gaming-themed avatar library** as safe alternatives
- **Peer reporting emphasis** (teens often self-police better than adults)
- **Parent notification system** for account creation (optional but recommended)

### Content Categories to Block
- Any partial nudity (stricter than adult sites)
- Simulated violence/weapons
- Drug/alcohol references
- Political extremism
- Self-harm content

## 5. Legal Compliance Updates

### Enhanced Requirements
- **Stricter COPPA-adjacent policies** (even though 16+, treat seriously)
- **Parental contact information** on file
- **Clear reporting mechanisms** for inappropriate content
- **Regular audits** of moderation effectiveness

## 6. Recommended Service Configuration

### Google Cloud Vision - Teen-Safe Settings

```javascript
const moderationConfig = {
  safeSearchDetection: {
    adult: 'VERY_UNLIKELY',      // Strictest setting
    violence: 'UNLIKELY',        // Conservative
    racy: 'VERY_UNLIKELY',      // Critical for teens
    medical: 'UNLIKELY',        // Conservative
    spoof: 'UNLIKELY'           // Prevent manipulation
  }
}
```

## 7. Backup Safety Net

### Manual Review Queue
- **All flagged content** goes to human moderators
- **24-hour review SLA** maximum
- **Trained moderators** familiar with teen safety standards
- **Appeal process** for false positives

### Community Tools
- **Easy reporting buttons** on all profiles
- **Anonymous reporting** to encourage use
- **Rapid response team** for urgent safety issues

## 8. Cost-Effective Teen-Safe Approach

### Recommended Stack
1. **Google Cloud Vision** (strict teen-safe mode)
2. **Manual review queue** for all edge cases
3. **User reporting system** with rapid response
4. **Graduated consequences** (temp bans â†’ permanent bans)
5. **Default avatar system** with gaming themes

### Budget Considerations
- Higher moderation costs due to stricter filtering
- More false positives requiring manual review
- Worth the investment for teen safety and legal protection

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
1. Implement Google Cloud Vision AI moderation
2. Set up manual review queue
3. Create gaming-themed default avatar library
4. Update terms of service for teen audience

### Phase 2: Enhanced Safety (Week 2-4)
1. Add account verification requirements
2. Implement user reporting system
3. Set up moderation dashboard
4. Train moderation team on teen safety standards

### Phase 3: Community Features (Month 2)
1. Add peer reporting mechanisms
2. Implement graduated consequence system
3. Regular audit and refinement of moderation rules
4. Parent notification system (optional)

## Key Principles

The key difference from adult-focused platforms is being **much more conservative** with what content is allowed, accepting higher false positive rates to ensure teen safety, and having robust manual review processes for edge cases.

This approach prioritizes:
- **Teen safety over convenience**
- **Proactive filtering over reactive removal**
- **Community standards appropriate for 16+ audience**
- **Legal compliance and liability protection**
