# Rating Table UPDATE Issue Debug Session

## Overview
Investigation into why UPDATE operations on the `rating` table are completely failing, even when executed through Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor with admin privileges.

## Initial Problem
- **game_progress table**: 4 records with missing slugs ✅ (fixed successfully)  
- **rating table**: 5 records with missing/incorrect slugs ❌ (all UPDATE attempts failing)

## Migration Files Created

### 001_fix_missing_and_duplicate_slugs.sql
- **Purpose**: Generate slugs for games with missing slugs and fix duplicate slugs
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully fixed game table (0 missing slugs reported)
- **Limitation**: Only targeted `game` table, not related tables

### 002_fix_missing_slugs_in_related_tables.sql  
- **Purpose**: Copy slugs from game table to game_progress and rating tables
- **Result**: ⚠️ Partially successful
  - game_progress: ✅ Fixed all 9 records
  - rating: ❌ Fixed 0 records

### 003_fix_all_rating_slugs.sql
- **Purpose**: Fix ALL rating slugs (both missing and incorrect ones)
- **Result**: ❌ Completely failed - no records updated

### 004_simple_rating_slug_fix.sql
- **Purpose**: Test individual hardcoded updates on specific records
- **Result**: ❌ Failed - no records updated
- **Test Results**:
  ```
  | id | game_id | slug                  | status    |
  | -- | ------- | --------------------- | --------- |
  | 1  | 34      | giants-citizen-kabuto | NOT_FIXED |
  | 4  | 39      | null                  | NOT_FIXED |
  ```

### 005_fix_rating_slugs_bypass_rls.sql
- **Purpose**: Temporarily disable Row Level Security to bypass restrictions
- **Result**: ❌ Failed - all 7 rating records still have issues
- **Remaining Issues**:
  ```

  ```

### 006_debug_rating_update_issue.sql
- **Purpose**: Diagnostic migration to understand update failures
- **Key Test**: Simple UPDATE with explicit hardcoded value
- **Result**: ❌ UPDATE_FAILED
  ```
  | info               | id | slug                  | status        |
  | ------------------ | -- | --------------------- | ------------- |
  | Update test result | 1  | giants-citizen-kabuto | UPDATE_FAILED |
  ```

### 007_check_rating_triggers.sql
- **Purpose**: Check for triggers or rules blocking updates
- **Test**: Direct hardcoded slug update
- **Result**: ❌ FAILED
  ```
  | test                    | id | game_id | slug                  | result |
  | ----------------------- | -- | ------- | --------------------- | ------ |

### 008_check_locks_and_transactions.sql

## Debug Session Progression

### Root Cause Investigation Timeline

1. **Initial Hypothesis**: Missing slugs in related tables
   - ✅ Confirmed: game_progress had 4 missing slugs
   - ✅ Confirmed: rating had 5 missing + 3 mismatched slugs

2. **Second Hypothesis**: Row Level Security blocking updates
   - ✅ Confirmed: RLS enabled with policy "Users can manage own ratings"  
   - ❌ RLS bypass attempt failed

3. **Third Hypothesis**: Read-only user permissions
   - ✅ Confirmed: Initial connection was `supabase_read_only_user`
   - ❌ User switched to Supabase Dashboard (admin privileges) but updates still failed

4. **Fourth Hypothesis**: Table-level restrictions or triggers
   - ⚠️ Under investigation
   - Even simple `UPDATE rating SET slug = slug WHERE id = 1` fails

### Current Status: UNSOLVED

**Symptoms**:
- ✅ SELECT operations work fine
- ❌ ALL UPDATE operations fail silently (no errors, no affected rows)
- ❌ Even trivial updates like `SET slug = slug` fail
- ❌ Even hardcoded value updates fail
- ✅ Same migration patterns work fine on `game_progress` table

**Environment**:
- **Platform**: Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (admin privileges)
- **User Context**: Full admin access confirmed
- **Table**: `rating` table with RLS enabled

### Error Messages Encountered

1. **Syntax Error with GET DIAGNOSTICS**:
   ```
   ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "GET"
   LINE 32: GET DIAGNOSTICS row_count = ROW_COUNT;
   ```

2. **Syntax Error with Comment Text**:
   ```
   ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "Run"
   LINE 24: Run this in the Dashboard SQL Editor.
   ```

### Final Diagnostic Test Results

**Test**: Most basic UPDATE operation possible
```sql
UPDATE rating SET slug = slug WHERE id = 1;
SELECT 'After update attempt' as test, id, slug FROM rating WHERE id = 1;
```

**Result**:
```
| test                 | id | slug                  |
| -------------------- | -- | --------------------- |
| After update attempt | 1  | giants-citizen-kabuto |
```

**Interpretation**: UPDATE operation executed without errors but had zero effect.

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Check table structure and constraints**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'rating' 
   ORDER BY ordinal_position;
   ```

2. **Check for triggers on rating table**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     t.tgname as trigger_name,
     t.tgenabled as enabled,
     pg_get_triggerdef(t.oid) as definition
   FROM pg_trigger t
   JOIN pg_class c ON t.tgrelid = c.oid
   WHERE c.relname = 'rating'
   AND t.tgisinternal = false;
   ```

3. **Test updates on other columns**
   ```sql
   UPDATE rating SET rating = rating WHERE id = 1;
   ```

## Hypothesis for Further Testing

The most likely remaining causes:
1. **Hidden trigger** that prevents all modifications to the rating table
2. **Column-level constraint** or **check constraint** blocking slug updates
3. **Foreign key constraint** issue with the slug column
4. **View-based table** where rating is actually a view, not a base table
5. **Materialized view** or **inherited table** structure

The fact that identical UPDATE patterns work on `game_progress` but fail completely on `rating` suggests table-specific restrictions rather than user permission issues.
