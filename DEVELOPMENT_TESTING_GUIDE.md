# Development Testing Guide - Signup UX

## Current Issue
Supabase email verification links always redirect to production site (`https://www.gamevault.to`) even when signing up from localhost, because the Supabase dashboard has global redirect URL settings.

## Safe Testing Options

### Option 1: Manual URL Replacement (Safest - No Production Impact)
1. Complete signup on `http://localhost:3000` with email alias
2. See the "Check Your Email!" success screen ✅
3. Check email for verification link (will point to live site)
4. Copy verification URL from email
5. Replace domain: `gamevault.to` → `localhost:3000`
6. Paste modified URL in browser
7. Should see AuthCallbackPage with success message

### Option 2: Add Development URL to Supabase (Low Risk)
**In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration:**
- Add to Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Keep existing: `https://www.gamevault.to/auth/callback`
- Test full flow with real email links
- Remove localhost URL when testing complete

### Option 3: Development Environment (Recommended for Future)
1. Create separate Supabase project for development
2. Copy database schema
3. Use different environment variables locally
4. Test without any production risk

## Current Implementation Status ✅
- Email verification success screen: ✅ Working
- Session storage personalization: ✅ Working  
- Loading states during signup: ✅ Working
- Auth callback handler: ✅ Created and tested
- Unit tests: ✅ All passing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors

## Test Results Expected
1. **Signup Form**: Shows loading state, then success screen
2. **Success Screen**: Displays "Check Your Email!" with user's email
3. **Email Link**: After URL modification, leads to verification success
4. **Final Result**: User verified and redirected to homepage

The UX improvements are fully functional - only the redirect URL needs configuration for seamless testing.
