# Fix Summary: Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Missing Data Issue

## Problem Identified
Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound (IGDB ID: 325580) exists in the database but has minimal data:
- ✅ Has: name, IGDB ID, slug, cover image, genre
- ❌ Missing: summary, description, developer, publisher, platforms, release date, screenshots

## Root Cause
The `gameDataService.ts` file was not saving all available fields when fetching games from IGDB API. When a game is not found in the database and fetched from IGDB (lines 106-126), only a subset of fields were being inserted.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/services/gameDataService.ts`
**Changes:** Updated the insert statement to include all available fields from IGDB:
- Added `description` field
- Added `pic_url` for compatibility
- Added `screenshots` array
- Added `category` field
- Added `alternative_names` array
- Added `franchise_name`
- Added `collection_name`
- Added `dlc_ids`, `expansion_ids`, `similar_game_ids` arrays

### 2. `src/services/igdbService.ts`
**Changes:** Enhanced the `transformGame` method to properly extract all data:
- Modified to use `storyline` for description (falls back to summary)
- Added screenshots mapping with URL transformation
- Fixed developer/publisher extraction to find specific roles
- Added screenshots to TransformedGame interface

### 3. `src/services/igdbService.ts` (Interface updates)
**Changes:** Updated interfaces to include missing fields:
- Added `screenshots?: string[]` to TransformedGame interface
- Added `storyline?: string` to IGDBGame interface
- Added `screenshots` array to IGDBGame interface
- Added `developer` and `publisher` boolean flags to involved_companies

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Existing Games (like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound)
Since the database has restricted permissions, the game needs to be refreshed through the application:

1. **Option A: Via the App UI**
   - Navigate to the game page for Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound
   - The app should detect missing data and re-fetch from IGDB automatically

2. **Option B: Force Refresh**
   - If you have admin access, delete the game record: `DELETE FROM game WHERE igdb_id = 325580;`
   - The next time someone searches for or accesses this game, it will be re-fetched with complete data

### For Future Games
All new games fetched from IGDB will now automatically include complete metadata thanks to the fixes applied.

## Verification
After the fix is deployed:
1. Search for "Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound" in the app
2. The game should now display:
   - Full summary/description
   - Developer information
   - Publisher information
   - Platform availability
   - Release date (if available on IGDB)
   - Screenshots (if available on IGDB)

## Impact
This fix affects all games that are fetched from IGDB but not yet in the database. The comprehensive data import ensures users have access to complete game information for better decision-making and review context.
