# Recommendation Badges Implementation in Activity Feed

## Overview
The Activity Feed displays "Recommended" and "Not Recommended" badges for user ratings, providing a quick visual indicator of whether a user recommends a game or not.

## Implementation Details

### Location
- **File**: `src/components/profile/ActivityFeed.tsx`
- **Lines**: 492-502 (approximately)

### Data Source
The recommendation status comes from the `rating` table in Supabase:
- **Field**: `is_recommended` (boolean)
- **Values**: 
  - `true` = Recommended
  - `false` = Not Recommended
  - `null`/`undefined` = No recommendation provided

### Display Logic

#### When Badges Appear
Badges are displayed only when:
1. The activity type is `'rating'` (not `'review'`)
2. The `is_recommended` field is not `null` or `undefined`

#### Visual Design
- **Recommended Badge**:
  - Background: `bg-green-900` (dark green)
  - Text: `text-green-300` (light green)
  - Text: "Recommended"

- **Not Recommended Badge**:
  - Background: `bg-red-900` (dark red)
  - Text: `text-red-300` (light red)
  - Text: "Not Recommended"

#### Badge Styling
- Size: `text-xs` (extra small text)
- Padding: `px-2 py-1` (horizontal and vertical padding)
- Shape: `rounded` (rounded corners)
- Position: Appears below review text (if present) and above the date

### Code Implementation

```typescript
{/* Recommendation badge - only show for ratings, not reviews */}
{activity.type === 'rating' && activity.is_recommended !== null && activity.is_recommended !== undefined && (
  <div className="mb-2">
    <span className={`text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded ${
      activity.is_recommended 
        ? 'bg-green-900 text-green-300' 
        : 'bg-red-900 text-red-300'
    }`}>
      {activity.is_recommended ? 'Recommended' : 'Not Recommended'}
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```

### Activity Type Distinction
The implementation distinguishes between two types of rating-related activities:
1. **Review** (`type: 'review'`): Has written text content - badges are hidden
2. **Rating** (`type: 'rating'`): Numeric score only - badges are shown if recommendation exists

This distinction ensures that reviews (which typically contain more nuanced opinions) don't have redundant recommendation badges, while quick ratings can show the recommendation status at a glance.

### Data Flow
1. Activity data is fetched from Supabase including the `is_recommended` field
2. Activities are transformed and typed with the `Activity` interface
3. During rendering, the badge conditionally appears based on activity type and recommendation status
4. The badge color and text dynamically change based on the boolean value

## Usage Notes
- The badges provide quick visual feedback without cluttering the UI
- They only appear where most relevant (standalone ratings)
- The color scheme follows standard UX patterns (green = positive, red = negative)
- The implementation is type-safe with TypeScript checking

## Current Status
**NOTE: As of the latest update, recommendation badges have been completely removed from the activity feed and no longer appear for any activity type.**
